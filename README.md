# Movie Recommendation System using Matrix Factorization

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **model-based collaborative filtering** approach to recommend movies using **matrix factorization (SVD)** on the MovieLens dataset. The goal is to predict user ratings for movies they haven't watched yet and suggest movies they may like.

## Dataset
- MovieLens dataset (CSV files)
- `movie.csv`: contains movie IDs and titles
- `rating.csv`: contains user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Merge `movie.csv` and `rating.csv`.
   - Filter and sample movies for demonstration.
   - Format the data for Surprise library: columns (userId, movieId, rating).

2. **Train/Test Split**
   - Split the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets.

3. **Model Training**
   - Use **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** to perform matrix factorization.
   - Learn latent factors representing users and movies.
   - Evaluate using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

4. **Model Tuning**
   - Optimize hyperparameters (`n_epochs`, `lr_all`) using **GridSearchCV**.
   - Select the best model based on RMSE.

5. **Final Predictions**
   - Train the final model on the full dataset.
   - Predict ratings for specific user-movie pairs.
   - Recommendations can be generated by selecting movies with the highest predicted ratings.

## Key Concepts
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposes the user-item rating matrix into latent factors to capture hidden patterns.
- **SVD**: Singular Value Decomposition, a popular method for collaborative filtering.
- **RMSE**: Metric to measure the difference between predicted and actual ratings. Lower values indicate better predictions.
